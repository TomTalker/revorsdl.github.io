An AB file stands for "Assets Bundle" in Unity.
  
<p>
  
It is what the game loads its music from.
  <p>

Preloaded levels, however, do not load their music from ".ab" files.  
  <p>

They instead load their music from ".resource" files.
  <p>

Preloaded levels are as follows:
  
- Cloud
  
- Hoop Dream
  
- Massif
  
- Clown Park
  
- Sunny
  
- 8bits
  
- The Winter
  
- Any new added level in the update you are editing
