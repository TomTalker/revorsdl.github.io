An AB file stands for "Assets Bundle" in Unity.
  
It is what the game loads its music from.
  
Preloaded levels, however, do not load their music from ".ab" files.  
  
They instead load their music from ".resource" files.
  
  
Preloaded levels are as follows:
  
- Cloud
  
- Hoop Dream
  
- Massif
  
- Clown Park
  
- Sunny
  
- 8bits
  
- The Winter
  
- Any new added level in the update you are editing
