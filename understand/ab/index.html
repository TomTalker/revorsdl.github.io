An AB file stands for "Assets Bundle" in Unity.
<br>
It is what the game loads its music from.
<br>
Preloaded levels, however, do not load their music from ".ab" files.  
<br>
They instead load their music from ".resource" files.
<br>
Preloaded levels are as follows:
<br>
  - Cloud
<br>
  - Hoop Dream
  <br>
- Massif
  <br>
- Clown Park
  <br>
- Sunny
  <br>
- 8bits
  <br>
- Winter
  <br>
- Any new added level in the update you are editing
