A CMR stands for "Cheetah Mobile Resource".
  <br>
Many would mistake it for being a custom file type but that would be wrong.
<br>
A CMR is a ZLIB image that is compressed and upside-down.
  <br>
  <br>
The process goes like this:
  <br>
Regular image file (ex. PNG, JPG, etc.) gets flipped upside down.
  <br>
That image is then converted into an RGBA file.
  <br>
That RGBA file is then compressed and turned into a ZLIB file.
  <br>
That ZLIB file is renamed to ".cmr".
  <br>
The file is ready to be used in-game.
