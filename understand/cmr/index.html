<p> A CMR stands for "Cheetah Mobile Resource". <p>
  
<p> Many would mistake it for being a custom file type but that would be wrong. <p>
  
<p> <p> 
  
<p> <p> 

<p> A CMR is a ZLIB image that is compressed and upside-down. <p>
  
<p> The process goes like this: <p>
  
<p> Regular image file (ex. PNG, JPG, etc.) gets flipped upside down. <p> 
  
<p> That image is then converted into an RGBA file. <p> 
  
<p> That RGBA file is then compressed and turned into a ZLIB file. <p> 
  
<p> That ZLIB file is renamed to ".cmr". <p>
  
<p> The file is ready to be used in-game. <p>
